1. Explain what the calculations above might or might not tell you about the "fairness" of your Naive Bayesian network.
By running the Naive Bayes model on the test data set, 99.95% of women end up with
P(Predicted Salary > $50K | Evidence) straightly greater than P(Predicted Salary > $50K | Evidence, Gender), while
0 % of men end up with P(Predicted Salary >$50K | Evidence) straightly greater than P(Predicted Salary >$50K | Evidence, Gender).
This suggests that the prediction is not well separated from gender as the result shows that the prediction heavily favour
women. Hence, the prediction is not fair in this case. Also, the prediction does not achieve demographic parity, since
the probability for men and women are way off.

2. Would you be willing to use your model to recommend starting salaries for employees at a firm? Why or why not?
I would not use this model to recommend starting salaries for employees since the result shows that the prediction may
not be fair and accurate. For men, there is only 66% correctly predict the salary is over 50K , while for women, there
is only 57% have a correct prediction.
